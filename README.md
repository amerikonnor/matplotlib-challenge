This project uses the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries in Python to do data analysis and plotting. The data is the results from a tumor medicine trial on mice.

The project did some data cleanup and summarizing first using pandas. After the data was formatted well and usable to plot, several graphs were created.

1. Total Measurements per Regimen.
2. Male vs. Female Distribution.
3. Boxplot of final tumor volume for each drug regimen.
4. Line plot of all measurements for a specific mouse.
5. Scatter plot of final tumor value for a regimen.
6. Scatter plot with linear regression of final tumor volume for a regimen.
